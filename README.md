This is a monorepo for all public elek.io code, including an UI library and design system, a Core library that handles logic of the CMS, a Next.js Client Frontend that represents the Clients GUI and the Client itself, which uses all of it and combines it into one electron application.

### CI/CD

CI/CD is handled by GitHub Actions. You can find it's configuration files inside `.github/workflows`. CI is mainly run on pull requests to validate the submitted code by linting, testing and building the application. CD is only run on releases / whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch and release drafts are automatically opened.
